## TASK:
CIPB-1.2: Create a map using network topology.

## CONDITIONS:
1. Given a known or unknown network configuration.
2. Working in concert with Team Leader&#39;s priorities and interactions with mission partner.
## STANDARDS:
1. **Identify flow of information, movement chokepoints and check points, and outside access.**
    1. Routers/Switches/Hubs/etc. â€“ Associated Bandwidth
    2. Sensors/sniffers
    3. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
    4. Firewalls/Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)
    5. Internet connections to the network
    6. Wireless connections to the network
2. **Identify and name regions or zones which allows freedom of movement.**
    1. Local Area Networks or VLANs
    2. Sections covered by Firewalls
    3. Sections allowing unobstructed lateral movement
    4. Extra devices allowed within zones
3. **Identify Servers, systems, applications (Email), and other services.**
    1. File servers
    2. Authentication systems
    3. Email server(s)
    4. ICS &amp; SCADA systems
    5. Operating Systems (within zones)
      1. Windows
      2. Unix
      3. Linux
      4. Mac
4. **Relevant metadata**
    1. Relevant IP/CIDR ranges
    2. Information not captured in previous standards
    3. Ownership of IP spaces
5. **Add information to common operating picture (COP) platform or to working report.**
## END STATE:
A functional network map that provides high visibility and situational awareness of the interoperability of the network in order to aid in data management through the operation and to help drive operations. The map should provide as much information as possible, such as network device metadata and OSI model information, at the very least, the first four layers (e.g. Physical, Data Link, Network, and Transport layers).
