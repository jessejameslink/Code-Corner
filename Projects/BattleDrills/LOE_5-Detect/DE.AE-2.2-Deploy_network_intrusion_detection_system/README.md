## Task

DETECT_AE_2_2_Deploy_Network_Intrusion_Detction_System
## Conditions

Deploy: Defensive Cyber Operations Element (DCO-E) supporting a mission partner or Guardnet/DoDIN enclave without appropriate Network IDS or IPS installations.
Evaluate: Defensive Cyber Operations Element (DCO-E) supporting a mission partner or Guardnet/DoDIN enclave with access to appropriate systems / capabilities to evaluate existing Network IDS or IPS installations.
## Standards

Deploy: Same as Evaluate (below) with the exception of assessing mission partner or Guardnet/DoDin enclave networks for placement of IDPS capabilities. Additionally, as requested or directed deploy IDPS capabilities. Once deployed, conduct the Evaluate process to assess operational effectiveness.
1. Identify and prepare Detection Systems.
a. Find what systems are available or what is necessary to Mission (likely to be directed if Unit is not allowed).
b. Identify/Rate strengths and weaknesses of systems.
c. Install necessary programs/systems critical to Mission.
2. Identify or Obtain login credentials
a. Obtain IP path to login.
b. Obtain/create User ID to login.
c. Obtain/create Password (ensure strong password creation).
3. Test accessibility.
a. Connect to the system with credentials.
b. Report inconsistencies
4. Develop the detection scheme.
a. Establish detection plan following the evaluation of the network (see below).
b. Re-evaluate and continue to develop improved detection throughout the mission.
Evaluate (and assess):
1. Identify and correlate current system to typical components and network architectures. Build or utilize a Common Operating Picture for the team. (see Figures 4-2 and 4-3, below)
2. Identify/locate potential entry points to network.
a. Identify Internet entry points.
b. Identify “contained” wireless connections within the network.
3. Identify/locate choke points and fire walls.
a. Identify locations on the network where information traffic must travel.
b. Identify fire wall control points and what is “protected by” the wall.
c. Grade firewalls on placement. (use Figures 4-2 and 4-3 to determine standards)
d. Grade protection of zones with independent fail conditions as safer. (i.e. if Zone A’s Firewall is lost is Zone B compromised as well? Does compromise fail a switch/router critical to multiple Zones?)
4. Identify/locate current detection systems, and sensors.
a. Identify where detection systems are located on the network.
b. Identify where on the system sensors are installed.
c. Identify path(s) from the DCO-E entry point to the detection system(s).
d. Identify paths from the detection system(s) to the network sensors.
e. Grade said sensors based on choke point vulnerabilities and Zones covered.
5. Identify full system maintenance schedule.
a. Patch schedule for network component firmware (routers, switches, etc.).
b. Patch schedule for each firewall.
c. Patch/update schedule for detection system.
d. Grade how often each related patch update is available and equivalent components are capable thereof.
Components and Architecture
 Typical Components
 Network Architectures
Security Capabilities
 Information Gathering Capabilities
 Logging Capabilities
 Detection Capabilities
 Prevention Capabilities
Management
 Implementation
 Operation and Maintenance
Considerations include both Wired and Wireless network IDPS capabilities
## End State

Deploy: DCO-E as requested (CTAA-role) or directed deploy IDPS capabilities. Once deployed, DCO-E assessed operational effectiveness and adjusts configurations as needed.
Evaluate: DCO-E develops and provides recommendations on improving mission partner or Guardnet/DoDIN enclave IDPS capabilities
